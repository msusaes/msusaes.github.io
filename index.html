						<h2 align="left">Words From Our President: Kourtney Klatt</h2>
						<p>I am very excited to be allowed to serve as president of the Society of Applied Engineering Sciences (SAES). This is my third year on the SAES Executive Board and my fourth year as a member of SAES. I first got involved in SAES during my freshman year at MSU, but it looked very different. I was living at home with my parents due to the dorms being closed for COVID. Living at home made me feel super disconnected from MSU. I was desperately looking for a way to get involved outside of classes and meet people within my major. In the AESC 110 class, I was given the assignment to attend a SAES meeting. I remember joining the virtual Zoom call and seeing 30+ students in my major talking about internship opportunities, social events, professional development, and leadership opportunities. That was exactly what I was looking for! I felt very welcomed in SAES and continued to attend meetings throughout that year. After being an active member my freshman year, I decided to join the Executive Board the following year. </p>

						<p>Being on the Executive Board for three years has given me a lot of insight into the foundation of SAES. This has allowed me to continue the traditions of SAES while implementing goals for continuous improvement. The three main areas I am focusing on for improvement are professional development, networking with members, and networking with employers. Here is how I am outlining those goals: </p>
						<div class="section-with-spacing">
						margin: 5px
						<p>Proffesional Development:</p>
							<p>It is a goal of mine to help our members increase their professional development skills. This year, we are dedicating an entire SAES meeting at the beginning of the year to professional development. Members will be guided on how to create a LinkedIn profile, prepare for interviews and career fairs, enhance their resume, and reach out to recruiters.</p>
						<p>Networking with Members:</p>
							<p>One of my favorite things about SAES is the ability to network with students within my major. A goal for this year is to see more interactions between members at meetings. We will be implementing ice breakers and interactive activities so members can move around the room and get to know each other.</p>
						<p>Networking with Employers:</p>
							<p>Increasing the interaction between members and employers is a huge goal of mine. To do this, we are adjusting the schedule for our general member meetings. We will now be doing a 20-minute company presentation followed by 40 minutes of open networking. This will allow members to make deeper connections with employers and enhance their networking experience.</p>
						</div>
						<p>With the help of my amazing Executive Board and AES faculty, I am confident we will reach our goals for this year and continue to grow SAES along with the AES major. I am very excited to serve as president and make it another great year for SAES!</p>
