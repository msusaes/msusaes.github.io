						<h2 align="left">Words From Our President: Michael Khzouz</h2>
						<p>Applied Engineering Sciences is the intersection of business and engineering, producing some of the most versatile and dynamic students at Michigan State University. At the core of this major is the Society of Applied Engineering Sciences, an organization that has long represented the achievements, innovation, and drive of AES students. The Society provides a space for applied engineers to connect, grow, and thrive, enhancing both the academic and social experience.</p>

						<p>For me, Applied Engineering Sciences has been more than just a major; it has been a community that has shaped me both professionally and personally. Surrounded by peers who share the same ambition, I have been challenged to succeed while also gaining experiences I never imagined possible as an engineer. Together, we challenge the stereotypes about engineers and demonstrate that it is possible to be technically skilled, business minded, and socially well rounded.</p>
						  
						<p>Many students in Applied Engineering Sciences, myself included, often say this major finds you. It attracts those who do not want to be confined to a single path but instead wish to explore multiple disciplines. I initially entered Civil Engineering but quickly realized I did not feel at home. Applied Engineering Sciences provided me with the opportunity to broaden my perspective by combining engineering fundamentals with business applications. Taking supply chain courses alongside calculus pushed me to constantly shift my mindset, and that challenge has shaped my adaptability. What unites AES students is this shared journey of discovery and balance, and through the Society, we have created a community that strengthens those connections.</p>
						
						<p>I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve this group of students as the President of the Society of Applied Engineering Sciences for the 2025 to 2026 academic year. This organization has given me so much, and I strive to give back by creating meaningful experiences that shape the futures of my peers. My aim is not only to connect students with their career aspirations but also to elevate the visibility of Applied Engineering Sciences to employers and industry leaders.</p>
						
						<p>This coming year, SAES will be focusing on 3 key objectives:</p>
						<ul style="list-style-type: number">
							<li align="left">Strengthening the relationship within the Executive Board and into the member base </li>
							<li align="left">Expanding alumni involvement to reconnect graduates with current students </li>
							<li align="left">Creating new and impactful events that foster professional growth </li></ul></p>

						<p>Already, the Executive Board has made significant progress. This year, we have launched a peer mentor program, organized a successful Industry Day with over one hundred students and eight companies, and established new partnerships with industries eager to engage with AES talent. These initiatives are only the beginning, and they reflect the passion and commitment of every member of the board.</p>
							
						<p>Looking ahead, I am excited about what we can accomplish together. With the foundation we are building today, I am confident that the Society will continue to grow stronger and create lasting opportunities for generations of Applied Engineering Sciences students to come! </p>
						<p><strong>-- Michael Khzouz, 2025/2026 SAES President</strong></p>
